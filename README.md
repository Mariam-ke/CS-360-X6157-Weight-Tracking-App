CS 360 Weight Tracking App

### Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
<p>The weight tracking app I developed addresses the needs of individuals aiming to lose weight, maintain weight, or track weight for medical reasons. The app enables users to monitor their daily weight, set a goal weight, and receive notifications upon reaching that goal. The primary objective is to assist users in achieving their weight-related goals by providing a user-friendly interface and essential features.</p>

### What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
<p>To cater to these user needs and create a user-centered UI, the app required several screens and features. These include a login screen for users to access their personal data, a dashboard screen to offer a quick overview of user progress, an "add weight" screen to enable users to input their daily weight and goal weight, and a notifications screen to set up and receive goal achievement notifications.

My UI designs prioritized simplicity, intuitive navigation, and clear visual cues, ensuring users could easily input data, track progress, and receive notifications. This user-centric approach contributed to the success of the designs by enhancing user understanding and engagement.</p>

### How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
<p>I began the coding process by collecting user requirements and creating wireframes to emphasize a user-friendly interface with intuitive navigation and clear visuals. This approach was aimed at helping users seamlessly interact with the app. I intend to apply the same techniques in the future, as they streamlined development and aligned well with user needs.</p>

### How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

<p>Throughout the coding process, I continuously tested the app on the emulator to verify the functionality of each screen and feature. This step-by-step testing was crucial to identify and rectify any bugs or issues that could potentially lead to app crashes. It ensured a smoother user experience and revealed areas that needed improvement.</p>

### Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

<p>During my initial experience with Android Studio, I faced challenges like generating the wrong file type and menu display issues. Through research, I discovered advanced features of the software and successfully addressed these challenges. For my final project, I proactively tackled menu implementation, drawing from my earlier experience to avoid such challenges.</p>

### In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

<p>I excelled in designing the UI and coding the app. While I had previous experience in UI design, wireframing, and prototyping, developing an entire app was a new and exciting endeavor. Despite the challenges, coding the app was enjoyable and showcased my ability to apply both design and technical skills to create a functional and user-centric mobile application.</p>
